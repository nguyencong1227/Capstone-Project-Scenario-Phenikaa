<p>The leadership team at AHI recently launched a strategic initiative to improve its understanding and analysis of its target market on a real-time basis. AHI has a robust marketing department. However, marketing analytics depends on numerous disconnected systems to provide the information needed to adapt to a changing competitive and technological environment.</p>
<p>The corporate team reviewed and approved a business case for developing an app for internal and external customers. This app will solicit, collect, and analyze information and data in critical areas and provide real-time analytics and information. The initial app will perform the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify, understand, and address current and developing segments and target markets (External)</li>
<li>Facilitate easier customer access to AHI products and pricing (External)</li>
<li>Enable secure invoicing and order processing (External)</li>
<li>Track current market trends in the skin care industry in real-time (Internal)</li>
<li>Monitor customer interest and preferences for AHI products based on opinion analysis (Internal)</li>
<li>Generate competitive analysis data by analyzing global sales data (Internal)</li>
<li>Calculate AHI market share and trends by product category (Internal)</li>
<li>Identify competitor products with the largest market share (Internal)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>AHI believes the design and implementation of this app will provide the following initial benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable faster introduction of new and updated products to the target market</li>
<li>Improve the overall AHI customer experience</li>
<li>Enable better positioning to be worked out through analysis of individual product sales</li>
<li>Enable better business decisions</li>
<li>Accelerate the testing of new product concepts</li>
<li>Gain insights into current shoppers and demographics</li>
<li>Enable improved brand tracking</li>
</ul>
<h4>Marketing Process</h4>
<p>AHI uses a five-step marketing process. The leadership of AHI believes that this process can be improved as follows:</p>
<h5>Step 1: Analyze opportunities:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Get a better understanding of the customer needs.</li>
<li>Get an improved analysis of competitive products.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Step 2: Select target market:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Get accurate and real-time buyer demographics.</li>
<li>Analyze potential market size and economic value</li>
</ul>
<h5>Step 3: Segment the market:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Determine the demographic characteristics of buyers.</li>
<li>Distinguish among different market segments.</li>
<li>Target the segments and position products more effectively</li>
</ul>
<h5>Step 4: Determine market strategies:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Make more 4-P decisions: product, price, place, and promotion.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Step 5: Evaluate results and realign:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the sales data.</li>
<li>Evaluate the financial data.</li>
<li>Evaluate the market share data</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="page-title">Contribution Statements</h3>
<p>Group submissions require a contribution statement. This should be submitted together with your submission, as a separate PDF using the Canvas "Add Another File" capability. When a contribution statement is required, we will not grade submissions until the contribution statement is provided.</p>
<p>This statement should indicate the name of each member of your team, the percentage of effort that each member contributed in that specific milestone, and a corresponding list of specific activities. An example contribution statement might be:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Name 1</em>: 20%, analyzed the business case.</li>
<li><em>Name 2</em>: 35%, created a project charter and stakeholder register</li>
<li><em>Name 3</em>: 10%, developed a work breakdown structure (WBS).</li>
<li><em>Name 4</em>: 35%, developed user stories, completed a product backlog...</li>
</ul>
<p>You should discuss and agree upon this statement of what you each contributed and how much this contributed to the overall assignment.</p>
<p>Contribution statements are intended to support your own reflection as a team as well as staff awareness of your efforts. The staff does not necessarily expect each person to contribute equally to each assignment, but does expect all members will appropriately contribute over the quarter and will work as a team to support each other. The staff also understands that percentages are incomplete and subjective, so we gather them only as a summary indication and will not use them directly in any grade calculation.</p>
<p>If you feel your team's contribution statement does not appropriately convey team contributions, you may email the course staff. If you feel a member of your team is not contributing appropriately, you may email the course staff.</p>
